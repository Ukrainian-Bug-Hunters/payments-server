 * above `connectionString` will require system user being able to access the `asd` db

 *
 * create user "Username" with login;
 * --- Username must be your name used to loging to your computer
 *
 * 2. edit connection policy to your Postgres db server to trust for
 * all connections localhost. this needs to be set in <path to pgsql server>\data\pg_hba.conf:
 * # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
 * # IPv4 local connections:
 * host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
